# Generic Apps

Folder with example generic apps.

Please do *not* put your developed Wiselib apps here,
as this should be kept at an overseeable amount of working example applications!

## Compiling

* Create the file `Makefile.local` and edit it to match your paths
* Go into the subdirectory of an example app and type `make`
