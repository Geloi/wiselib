This folder contains code for implementation of FAT filesystem compliant with standard FAT filesystem (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32).
The code for this library was written keeping FAT32 in mind and hence there maybe some bugs with FAT16 or FAT12. Feel free to test and raise any issues/bugs for the same.

An app using the FAT32 filesystem can be found under wiselib/apps/generic_apps/fat_ftl_demo.

Constructive feedback is welcome.
